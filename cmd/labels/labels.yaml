    # Priority
    - color: fef2c0
      description: Lowest priority. Possibly useful, but not yet enough support to actually get it done. # These are mostly place-holders for potentially good ideas, so that they don't get completely forgotten, and can be referenced /deduped every time they come up.
      name: priority/awaiting-more-evidence
    - color: fbca04
      description: Higher priority than priority/awaiting-more-evidence. # There appears to be general agreement that this would be good to have, but we may not have anyone available to work on it right now or in the immediate future. Community contributions would be most welcome in the mean time (although it might take a while to get them reviewed if reviewers are fully occupied with higher priority issues, for example immediately before a release).
      name: priority/backlog
    - color: e11d21
      description: Highest priority. Must be actively worked on as someone's top priority right now. # Stuff is burning. If it's not being actively worked on, someone is expected to drop what they're doing immediately to work on it. Team leaders are responsible for making sure that all the issues, labeled with this priority, in their area are being actively worked on. Examples include user-visible bugs in core features, broken builds or tests and critical security issues.
